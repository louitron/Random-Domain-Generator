Random Domain Generator. Initially based on a 4Geeks prohject where I supposed to generate all the possible combinations to an array in a .js script. I did that, and it's printed in the console. However, I went a little further and coded a random domain name generator which uses a library of pronouns, nouns, and adjectives to generate 5 random names on each button click. Has about 300,000 different possible combinations.
